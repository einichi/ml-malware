# ml-malware
Quick experiment to see if converting malware and non-malware binaries to B&amp;W images and running them through a residual image recognition machine learning model has a good detection rate or not

Preliminary testing suggests it works pretty well, though I've not tested it with a vast range of malwares (trained with 30 or so specimens and tested with a handful of different ones).

You can try it out yourself here: https://ml-malware.herokuapp.com/

Or open the Jupyter notebook up in a Paperspace notebook instance or Google Colab and train a model of your own.
